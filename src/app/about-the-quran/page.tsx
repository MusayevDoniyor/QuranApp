          <p className="mb-1">
            The most conventional answer is that the Quran is a book - but it is
            not like most books. It is made up of words which contain truth and
            guidance for every human being, and Muslims believe that these are
            words revealed directly by God, in the Arabic language, to the last
            of His prophets and messengers, Muhammad ﷺ (peace be upon him).{" "}
            <br />
            The Quran presents itself with a number of names and descriptions
            which are worth reflecting on. Here are just a few:
          </p>

          <ul className="flex flex-col gap-1 pl-5">
            <li>
              <span className="pr-2">a.</span> Quran and Kitab (Recital & Writ):
              the first means something recited aloud, and the second means
              something written down. This describes the two main ways this
              scripture is experienced, and which you can encounter on this
              website.
            </li>

            <li>
              <span className="pr-2">b.</span>
              Kalam Allah (Divine Speech): this means that these words are a
              direct communication from the Creator and Master of every living
              being. It occupies the highest level of authority for its
              believers, and it is clarified and supported by the teachings of
              the Prophet ﷺ. While the language of this particular revelation
              was Arabic, we also have many translations into different
              languages which help us to understand its meanings.
            </li>

            <li>
              <span className="pr-2">c.</span>
              Dhikr and Huda (Remembrance & Guidance): the Quran is used as a
              way to connect with God and keep Him in our hearts and on our
              tongues. It is also fundamentally a guide for our personal lives
              and for the life of the community and society.

          <div className="my-2">
            The Quran is the final revealed message which complements and
            completes earlier revealed scriptures, just as the Prophet Muhammad
            ﷺ taught the same essential message as the many prophets before him,
            including Adam, Noah, Moses, Abraham, and Jesus (peace be upon them
            all). The Quran clarifies what humanity needs to know from now until
            the Day of Judgment, and it will remain preserved from loss and
            distortion which affected previous scriptures in various ways.
            "˹This is˺ a blessed Book which We have revealed to you ˹O Prophet˺
            so that they may contemplate its verses, and people of reason may be
            mindful."

            What are some major themes in the Quran?
          </h2>

          <p>
            There are many themes and ideas explored in the Quran, but the major
            ones include:
          </p>

          <ul className="flex flex-col gap-1 pl-8 my-2 list-disc">
            <li>The Oneness of God</li>
            <li>The importance of worship and obedience to God</li>
            <li>The existence of an Afterlife and the Day of Judgment</li>
            <li>Guidance and wisdom for leading a righteous and moral life</li>
            <li>The creation of the universe and all living things</li>
            <li>The role of prophets and revelation in guiding humanity</li>
            <li>The consequences of good and evil actions</li>
            <li>The significance of social justice and fairness</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            These themes are interwoven throughout the Quran and serve as a
            guide for believers on how to live their lives in accordance with
            the will of God.

            How do we know the Quran is authentic?
          </h2>

          <p className="mb-1">
            The Quran does not demand blind belief, but instead it invites all
            human beings to study, reflect and follow the evidence. These are
            some of the broad aspects which lead Muslims to be convinced of the
            truth and accuracy of the Quran as the revealed Word of God:
          </p>

          <ul className="flex flex-col gap-1 pl-4">
            <li>
              <span className="pr-2">a.</span>
              Historical: material and living evidence points to the fact that
              the Quran has been transmitted both orally and in writing from the
              time of the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ, who announced at the age of forty
              (around 610 CE) that he was receiving revelation of these words
              from an angel sent by the One God. The content of this message
              together with the Prophet's impeccable character, integrity and
              credibility created a believing community, at first in Arabia,
              which carried the Quran to all parts of the world.
            </li>

            <li>
              <span className="pr-2">b.</span>
              Teachings: not only did the Quran create a revolution in the lives
              of the Arabs when it was revealed, but it continues to effect
              positive change for individuals and communities who follow its
              teachings. Together with the practical example and explanations of
              the Prophet ﷺ, the message is its own strongest proof that it
              comes from the Creator who knows what is best for creation.
            </li>

            <li>
              <span className="pr-2">c.</span>
              Miracles: the Quran declares itself inimitable, and those eloquent
              Arabs who at first opposed its message found themselves unable to
              meet the challenge to come up with anything like it. This points
              to what is known as the literary miracle of the Quran, which means
              a level of eloquence beyond human ability. However, there are many
              dimensions to what makes the Quran unique and miraculous, and more
              is discovered as human knowledge expands.

            Can the Quran be translated?
          </h2>

          <p>
            The global Muslim population is vast and diverse, reflecting the
            richness of the Islamic faith and its adaptability to different
            cultural contexts. Muslims come from different ethnicities,
            cultures, and languages, and are spread across every continent in
            the world. It is estimated that there are around 2 billion Muslims
            worldwide. The majority of Muslims live in Asia, with Indonesia
            being the country with the highest number of Muslims, followed by
            Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh. However, there are also significant
            Muslim populations in Africa, the Middle East, Europe, and North
            America.

          <p>
            The Quran has been translated into over 100 different languages, and
            each translation can be considered its own interpretation of the
            original Arabic text. It is important to note, however, that the
            Quran is the word of God and is therefore sacred and unchangeable.
            As such, translations of the Quran are intended to convey the
            meaning of the original Arabic text as accurately as possible, but
            they may differ in their interpretation of certain passages.
